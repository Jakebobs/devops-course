## Description

In our tutorial we will show how to set up a demo for your web service using the pages function of GitHub to give you a working bootstrap and not having to find a hosting solution. Instead only requiring a GitHub organisation.

**Relevance**

Being able to rapidly prototype is a very useful tool in the beginning of creating a web service. Not having to spend time on setting up back-end solutions and instead being able to focus on working out features. Using GitHub pages is according to us one of the simplest solutions for doing this and unlike Canva Pro and Adobe XD also available for free.
